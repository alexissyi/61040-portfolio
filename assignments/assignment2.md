## Problem Statement

### Problem Domain

**WILG Meal Plan** The WILG meal plan provides 6 dinners a week, all cooked by house members, and snacks and breakfast items. Executing this meal plan involves 1) creating a cooking calendar each month based on member availability, assigning members as cooks for each cooking day; 2) collating dinner ingredients on a weekly basis; 3) collating snack and breakfast item requests on a weekly basis; 4) ordering all the groceries through various channels, including produce vendors, meat vendors and Instacart; 5) tracking food allergies and dietary restrictions. These tasks are managed by two members of WILG Exec, known as foodstuds. Currently dinners must be enough to feed 35 people, with various dietary restrictions accommodated. I am president of WILG and also regularly cook for the house, so I'm interested in making this process easier for cooks and WILG foodstuds in particular.

### Problem

**[WILG Meal Plan Cooking Assignments]** Everything outlined above is done manually and across various spreadsheets, forms and even random Slack threads (WILG communication occurs via Slack). In particular, member cooking availabilities are collected via a form and then one of the foodstuds manually assigns cooks based on the calendar. This often requires multiple revisions since people's availabilities can change.

### Stakeholder List

1. WILG Food Stewards: the two members of WILG Exec who are in charge of creating a cooking calendar, assigning cooks, and ordering groceries. Any automation of their task could make their task easier; a more customized UI (in comparison to Google Sheets) could also make their task easier and reduce the amount of time they spend on their role obligations. Learning a UI or software could also be a barrier though.

2. WILG Cooks: the residents of WILG who are assigned to cook on WILG's cooking calendar. A more customized UI could make it easier to enter availability and update that availability, as well as communicate with the food stewards. Learning a new UI could also be a barrier like above.

3. WILG Residents: individuals who are automatically on WILG's meal plan and eat dinners from the WILG calendar. Automation of the cooking schedule can reduce the chance that there's no one assigned to one day or that someone has to drop and so we have to eat leftovers.

### Evidence and Comparables

1. [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com/). A meal-planning app that allows for ingredient collating, linking of recipes, and scheduling meals. Good for an individual, but not super compatible with WILG's cooking system, which involves specific distinctions between ingredients and also involves assigning different people to different days.

2. [Meal planning is associated with food variety, diet quality and body weight status in a large sample of French adults](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5288891/). This article discusses how meal planning, at least on an individual basis, improves health metrics for adults.

3. [Kooka Cooking Community](https://www.kookacommunity.com/). A meal-planning/recipe-planning website that allows for scheduling and ingredient collection. Has similar limitations to Paprika.

4. [Why Communal Living Can Make Us Happier](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240429-why-living-with-strangers-can-make-us-happier). This article discusses how communal living systems that involve chore schedules and cooking plans or other modes of shared responsibility can help provide community and alleviate burdens.

5. My personal experience as a member of WILG and current president. As president, I often have to help the foodstuds trouble shoot problems, like rearranging the cooking calendar or getting missing ingredients. Assigning cooks is one of the first tasks in the pipeline of executing the WILG meal plan and all the other aspects of dinner follow after this. As a cook, sometimes I have to let the foodstuds that my availability wasn't accommodated, so the assignments need to be updated.
