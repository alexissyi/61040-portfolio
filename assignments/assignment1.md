# Assignment 1

## Domains

Most promising domains: WILG administration, tracking health problems, tracking clothing and shoe sizes

1. WILG administration: WILG has a lot of complex processes behind the scenes that help keep the house running that are currently run manually. We have a cooking schedule with dinner 6x a week, all cooked by house members, and we need to order groceries for these dinners and for general snacks/breakfast. We also have a chore system involving kitchen jobs, house jobs and bathroom jobs.

2. Learning guitar: I like learning guitar but I'm not super organized about it

3. Working out: I work out regularly but have never tracked progress and sometimes feel stalled or plateaued.

4. Applying to jobs: I try to keep up with applications but procrastinate a lot and sometimes also have difficulty finding jobs that I'm actually interested in.

5. Trying new skincare products: I try out a lot of products but don't feel I've developed many opinions or that I've found go-to brands.

6. Learning to sew: I'm trying to learn to sew but am very disorganized about it and don't do it very consistently.

7. Health problems and complaints: I have a lot of physical complaints that I tend to forget about until symptoms appear again. I also don't currently have a super organized way to track my progress in addressing these complaints, and in many instances have not actually made much progress in the first place.

8. Streaming music: I listen to music exclusively through streaming services, which makes me nervous, and I'd like to have less centralized ways to stream music and track my listening.

9. Clothes, fashion and style: I like trying new clothes and outfits, but I have a problem with overconsuming clothes sometimes. I'm also a different size in pretty much every single brand and also have multiple shoe sizes. I also thrift all my clothes, and a lot of older clothing is on a completely different size scale. I don't currently have a very organized way of tracking all these sizes outside of my notes app. I also don't really have a system for tracking cuts/styles that I like besides memory.

10. Getting rid of stuff I don't need: I hoard things and have to consciously figure out how to get rid of things.

## Problems

### Domain 1: WILG administration

** Problem 1.1: Filling in cooking ingredients and collating them. Currently we just use a gigantic spreadsheet to assign cooks and fill in ingredients that's kind of unwieldy to use. Our food steward also have to manually collate all the ingredients to figure out what to order. **

** Problem 1.2: Assigning and tracking chore completion. This is done via a Google form and witnessing system that our house managers have to manually track and collect every month. Missed chores result in fines, but these fines increase exponentially, not linearly. People also can swap chores, which has to be tracked manually. **

Problem 1.3: Assigning rooms. We do this manually as well, and this involves sending emails at regular intervals to every person in the house. Sometimes we have to re-do the whole process when new information about accommodations or preferences come out, which is really annoying.

### Domain 2: Health problems and complaints

Problem 2.1: Tracking symptom development and evolution. I tend to just do this in my head, which results in me forgetting problems until symptoms reappear or get worse.

Problem 2.2: Collating clinical opinions. I've seen multiple clinicians for health problems in the past, but usually just track what they say in my head. I have no centralized place to keep them.

** Problem 2.3: Tracking treatments and effectiveness. Sometimes I try different treatments but forget that I have or don't remember the exact effects. **

### Domain 3: Clothes, fashion and style

Problem 3.1: Tracking clothing and shoe sizes for specific items and brands. I'm a different size for different brands and even for different items within brands. It would be good to have a centralized place for this that I can have handy while out shopping or when shopping online. Currently I have a notes app but it's getting a little hard to read.

Problem 3.2: Identifying styles and cuts that I like. Multiple times in the past I have re-discovered a cut or style that I already had but forgot that I like. I also wonder if there are patterns in the clothes I have right now that I just haven't noticed yet.

Problem 3.3: Hoarding clothes that I don't really like anymore. I have a lot of clothes I don't really wear and I tend to put off getting rid of them or I get rid of them right before I realize I could've modified it and still kept wearing it.
