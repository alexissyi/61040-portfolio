# Assignment 1

## Domains

1. WILG administration: WILG has a lot of complex processes behind the scenes that help keep the house running that are currently run manually. We have a cooking schedule with dinner 6x a week, all cooked by house members, and we need to order groceries for these dinners and for general snacks/breakfast. We also have a chore system involving kitchen jobs, house jobs and bathroom jobs.

2. Learning guitar

3. Working out

4. Applying to jobs

5. Trying new skincare products

6. Learning to sew

7. Tracking health problems: I have a lot of physical complaints that I tend to forget about until symptoms appear again. I also don't currently have a super organized way to track my progress in addressing these complaints, and in many instances have not actually made much progress in the first place.

8. Creating portable playlists

9. Tracking clothing and shoe sizes for brands and specific items: I'm a different size in pretty much every single brand and also have multiple shoe sizes. I don't currently have a very organized way of tracking all these sizes outside of my notes app.

10. Getting rid of stuff I don't need
