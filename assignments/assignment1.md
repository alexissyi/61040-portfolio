# Assignment 1

## Domains

Most promising domains: WILG administration, tracking health problems, tracking clothing and shoe sizes

1. WILG administration: WILG has a lot of complex processes behind the scenes that help keep the house running that are currently run manually. We have a cooking schedule with dinner 6x a week, all cooked by house members, and we need to order groceries for these dinners and for general snacks/breakfast. We also have a chore system involving kitchen jobs, house jobs and bathroom jobs.

2. Learning guitar: I like learning guitar but I'm not super organized about it

3. Working out: I work out regularly but have never tracked progress and sometimes feel stalled or plateaued.

4. Applying to jobs: I try to keep up with applications but procrastinate a lot and sometimes also have difficulty finding jobs that I'm actually interested in.

5. Trying new skincare products: I try out a lot of products but don't feel I've developed many opinions or that I've found go-to brands.

6. Learning to sew: I'm trying to learn to sew but am very disorganized about it and don't do it very consistently.

7. Health problems and complaints: I have a lot of physical complaints that I tend to forget about until symptoms appear again. I also don't currently have a super organized way to track my progress in addressing these complaints, and in many instances have not actually made much progress in the first place.

8. Streaming music: I listen to music exclusively through streaming services, which makes me nervous, and I'd like to have less centralized ways to stream music and track my listening.

9. Clothes, fashion and style: I like trying new clothes and outfits, but I have a problem with overconsuming clothes sometimes. I'm also a different size in pretty much every single brand and also have multiple shoe sizes. I also thrift all my clothes, and a lot of older clothing is on a completely different size scale. I don't currently have a very organized way of tracking all these sizes outside of my notes app. I also don't really have a system for tracking cuts/styles that I like besides memory.

10. Getting rid of stuff I don't need: I hoard things and have to consciously figure out how to get rid of things.

## Problems

Most worthwhile problems are problem 1.1, problem, 1.2 and problem 2.3 below.

### Domain 1: WILG administration

**Problem 1.1: [WILG Cooking Calendar] Filling in cooking ingredients and collating them. Currently we just use a gigantic spreadsheet to assign cooks and fill in ingredients that's kind of unwieldy to use. Our food steward also have to manually collate all the ingredients to figure out what to order. This is selected because it seems that an easy-to-use UI could help streamline the process.**

**Problem 1.2: [WILG Chores] Assigning and tracking chore completion. This is done via a Google form and witnessing system that our house managers have to manually track and collect every month. Missed chores result in fines, but these fines increase exponentially, not linearly. People also can swap chores, which has to be tracked manually. This is selected because a lot of the tasks involved here (tracking hours, calculating fines) can be automated.**

Problem 1.3: Assigning rooms. We do this manually as well, and this involves sending emails at regular intervals to every person in the house. Sometimes we have to re-do the whole process when new information about accommodations or preferences come out, which is really annoying. This isn't selected because it's a one-off task that can be made more efficient without the use of software.

### Domain 2: Health problems and complaints

Problem 2.1: Tracking symptom development and evolution. I tend to just do this in my head, which results in me forgetting problems until symptoms reappear or get worse. This isn't selected because a notes app might be able to handle this sufficiently, and it's also pretty related to problem 2.3.

Problem 2.2: Collating clinical opinions. I've seen multiple clinicians for health problems in the past, but usually just track what they say in my head. I have no centralized place to keep them. This isn't selected because Google Drive could probably handle this; this is just a problem of file organization.

**Problem 2.3: [Treatment Tracking] Tracking treatments and effectiveness. Sometimes I try different treatments but forget that I have or don't remember the exact effects. This is selected because I think this would also help motivate me to pursue treatments and clinical opinions.**

### Domain 3: Clothes, fashion and style

Problem 3.1: Tracking clothing and shoe sizes for specific items and brands. I'm a different size for different brands and even for different items within brands. It would be good to have a centralized place for this that I can have handy while out shopping or when shopping online. Currently I have a notes app but it's getting a little hard to read. This isn't selected because I don't go shopping enough for this to be super important.

Problem 3.2: Identifying styles and cuts that I like. Multiple times in the past I have re-discovered a cut or style that I already had but forgot that I like. I also wonder if there are patterns in the clothes I have right now that I just haven't noticed yet. This isn't selected because it would require me to upload all the clothes in my closet which feels prohibitive.

Problem 3.3: Hoarding clothes that I don't really like anymore. I have a lot of clothes I don't really wear and I tend to put off getting rid of them or I get rid of them right before I realize I could've modified it and still kept wearing it. This isn't selected for the same reason as 3.2.

## Stakeholders

### Problem 1: WILG Cooking Calendar

1. WILG Food Stewards: the two members of WILG Exec who are in charge of creating a cooking calendar, assigning cooks, and ordering groceries. Any automation of their task could make their task easier; a more customized UI (in comparison to Google Sheets) could also make their task easier and reduce the amount of time they spend on their role obligations. Learning a UI or software could also be a barrier though.

2. WILG Cooks: the residents of WILG who are assigned to cook on WILG's cooking calendar. A more customized UI could make it easier to add ingredients and reduce procrastination time, reducing the chance that they miss their ingredient deadline and have to buy ingredients themselves. Learning a new UI could also be a barrier like above.

3. WILG Residents: individuals who are automatically on WILG's meal plan and eat dinners from the WILG calendar. Automation of the cooking schedule and ingredient collection could mean more complex dinners are possible, or reduce the amount of times dinner is late or has other problems, like not properly accommodating restrictions.

### Problem 2: WILG Chores

1. WILG Jobs House Manager: the member of WILG Exec who is in charge of assigning chores, tracking chores, and calculating missed chore fines. Similar impacts to the food stewards in the previous problem. Automation and more customized UI could make their job faster and easier, but could be onerous to learn a new software.

2. WILG Treasurer: the member of WILG Exec who issues bills to collect fines. There might not be much impact, since the treasurer doesn't calculate the fines themselves. Having one known place where the fines are could make it easier for them to find them at the end of the semester, rather than having to communicate with the house manager.

3. WILG Residents: individuals who are obligated to complete a certain number of chores in WILG. Having one centralized place to track chores could make keeping track of their own missed chores easier, but could also be onerous to learn a new software.

### Problem 3: Treatment Tracker

1. Individuals w/ Health Concerns: people who have health complaints of any kind. A treatment tracker could help them identify what does and does not work with them; they could share this info with providers for better care. However, this kind of sensitive data would also be at risk for data breaches, which could be really dangerous.

2. Healthcare Providers: clinicians who treat people with various health complaints. A treatment tracker could help them quickly understand what their patient has already tried, and allow them to rule those treatments out. However, if the treatments are tracked by patients, the patient's lack of expertise could skew the information included and make it misleading.

3. Healthcare Researchers: researchers who investigate the effectiveness of certain treatments and the causes of certain symptoms and ailments. A treatment tracker could help them identify similarities across multiple patients and lead to breakthroughs in treatment and understanding. However, if the tracker relies on self-input, the data could be questionable.

## Evidence

### Problem 1: WILG Cooking Calendar

1. [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com/). A meal-planning app that allows for ingredient collating, linking of recipes, and scheduling meals. Good for an individual, but not super compatible with WILG's cooking system, which involves specific distinctions between ingredients and also involves assigning different people to different days.

2. [Meal planning is associated with food variety, diet quality and body weight status in a large sample of French adults](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5288891/). This article discusses how meal planning, at least on an individual basis, improves health metrics for adults.

3. [Kooka Cooking Community](https://www.kookacommunity.com/). A meal-planning/recipe-planning website that allows for scheduling and ingredient collection. Has similar limitations to Paprika.

### Problem 2: WILG Chores

1. [OurHome](http://ourhomeapp.com/). A family chore tracking app that allows families to track chores and assigns points to those who complete their chores. Good for a family, but not super compatible with WILG, which is a 30+ member community with very specific chores that come with specific time frames. This app also does not have chore swapping or fine tracking.

2. [Communal Intimacy: Formalization, Egalitarianism, and Exchangeability in Collective Housing](https://academic.oup.com/sf/article/100/1/273/5933783?login=true). This research paper discusses how communal living tends to demand egalitarianism in the distribution of chores and tasks in comparison to family living, and that this egalitarianism actually contributes to communal intimacy.

3. [Co-Housing to Ease and Share Household Chores? Spatial Visibility and Collective Deliberation as Levers for Gender Equality](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-5309/11/5/189) This research paper discusses how in one investigation into co-housing projects in Brussels, egalitarian distribution of chores within a shared communal living space can ease burdens on individuals and allow women to lead more socially and politically engaged lives.

4. [Why Communal Living Can Make Us Happier](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240429-why-living-with-strangers-can-make-us-happier). This article discusses how communal living systems that involve chore schedules and cooking plans or other modes of shared responsibility can help provide community and alleviate burdens.

### Problem 3: Treatment Tracker

1. [Treatment Tracker App](https://careclinic.io/treatment-tracker/). An app that mainly tracks pharmaceutical and supplement treatments.

2. [Wave Health: Symptom Tracker](https://www.wavehealth.app/). An app that tracks symptoms, medications, mood and other things like physical activity and water intake. Might be overloaded with different features, but seems to encompass everything necessary for the problem.

3. [Measurement-based care: A transformative approach to treatment](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2025/01/measurement-based-care-transforms-treatment). This article discusses how at least in psychological treatment, regular check-ins on certain metrics can help treatment.

4. [Monitoring Treatment Progress and Providing Feedback is Viewed Favorably but Rarely Used in Practice](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5495625/). This article discusses how measuring treatment effectiveness over time is both clinically effective and positively viewed by clinicians but not actually used.

## Features

### Problem 1: WILG Cooking Calendar

1. A calendar UI where the food stewards can enter names to assign cooks, so they can do it in one page instead of having to flip through a bunch of spreadsheet tabs.

2. Clickable calendar squares that navigate to a day-specific ingredients page that cooks can fill out for their cooking day. This also reduces the need to flip through a bunch of spreadsheet tabs.

3. An automatic recipe scaler that allows cooks to copy a recipe for fewer people directly, which then gets scaled to serve 30-35 people (or however many people are currently living in WILG). This reduces the amount of time it takes to add ingredients for cooks.

### Problem 2: WILG Chores

1. A public hours tracker that automatically tracks how many chores everybody has completed. This allows WILG residents to understand how many hours they owe and also verify that their hours are being tracked accurately. This also reduces the need for the house manager to manually track and enter hours.

2. A form for people to submit their hours. This could be tied to an account, so a person could maybe just click a button rather than having to enter their information into a Google form every time.

3. A witness request system where people can request a witness from another person in the house, and that person will then approve the witness request. This could reduce witness fraud, where a person records someone as a witness who actually hasn't witnessed it.

### Problem 3: Treatment Tracker

1. A dashboard with all the ailments a person has, separated into categories. This could help an individual get an overall picture of their health problems also.

2. For each ailment, a list of treatments. This helps an individual get a sense of what they've tried.

3. For each treatment, a page of the details of that treatment, like when it occurred, what it involved, who provided it, the effects, etc.
